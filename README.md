# Websocket

This is a package for building websocket resources in C++. You might be asking "Why not use the other libraries that exist?"

The primary driver is learning. I can learn more about C++, how to optimize C++ code, and re-familiarize myself with how
to handle networking at the system level. That, and, I can build what I want.

## Testing

There is a test server you can run in the `test_server` folder. It requires nodejs v18+. Simply `cd` into the folder
and run `npm run start`. The default port is `18080`.
